    ALGUMAS SUGESTÕES PARA VOCÊ

    Hotel California
    EAGLES
    Last thing I remember
    I was running for the door
    I had to find the passage back
    To the place I was before
    Relax, said the night man
    We are programmed to receive
    You can check out any time you like
    But you can never leave

    While My Guitar Gently Weeps
    The Beatles - George Harrison
    I look from the wings at the play you are staging
    While my guitar gently weeps
    As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
    Still my guitar gently weeps

    Gravidade
    Supercombo
    Eu vou te mostrar o quanto eu sou capaz
    Capaz de aguentar o quanto for
    Preciso
    Preciso, preciso
    Pode até chover
    Pode desabar
    E o que tiver que ser será
    E o que tiver que ser
    Não há nada

    Miss You
    The Rolling Stones
    Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
    You've been starring in my dreams
    Lord, I miss you
    I've been waiting in the hall
    Been waiting on your call
    When the phone rings
    It's just some friends of mine, that say

    Lonely Day
    System Of A Down
    And if you go
    I wanna go with you
    And if you die
    I wanna die with you
    Take your hand and walk away
